# Number-Guess-Game-Using-Python-By-Amit
Hey It's Amit Here 
Again with fun game to play called "Guess The Number" so in this game you'll get 5 chance to guess the number right
you have to guess the right number in 5 attempts, the number will be in 1-100, i know the number should be 1-200 but i change it to 1-100
because it's there's really low chance of guessing the number right in 1-100 so it would be obviously difficult to guess the right number in 1-200, so anyways as per my experience if you wanted to win this game in first attempt write the number 50, then if the number 50 is not the answer then it will show you try higher number or lower number, according to that you can guess the number and yeah then you can try 25-30 if its telling you 2 try lower or 70-75 if it's showing to try  higher than 50, 

REMEBER THE NUMBER WILL BE DIFFERENT EVERY TIME SO, as per 9th line you can see in the program that the number will eb selected randomly bet between 1-100 so Best of luck playing this fun game and hope you'll understand the program easily, i have tried my best to keep the program simple and easy to understand for other programmers or users , if you wanna increase the attempt or number to guess simply change the max_attempts from line 11th for increasing or decreasing attempts
and yes same apply for the number from 1-100 if u wanna change it from 1-100  to 1-50  or 1-150, 1-200 it's up to you

Enjoy have fun learning and playing ;)
